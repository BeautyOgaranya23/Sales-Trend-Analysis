# Key Business Insights
Detailed analysis of the pizza sales data has uncovered critical insights that can drive operational efficiency and strategic growth. These findings are essential for understanding customer behavior, optimizing resources, and enhancing marketing efforts. Here are the key insights from this analysis:

*  Peak sales hours are typically within the afternoon, between 12 PM and 1 PM. This aligns with typical lunch breaks, where many customers, including office groups and families, prefer ordering pizzas as a convenient and satisfying lunch option. 
* Large-sized pizzas contribute significantly to overall revenue, suggesting a preference for larger portions among customers.
* The highest number of pizza orders occur on weekdays, specifically from Mondays to Wednesdays. This can be attributed to workplace lunch orders, routine-driven convenience, and midweek promotions or discounts.
* Monthly revenue distribution exhibits seasonal variations, with higher revenue during certain months, possibly influenced by holidays or special events.
